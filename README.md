## Dataset Description

The RandPerson dataset is generated by [MakeHuman](http://www.makehumancommunity.org/) and [Unity3D](https://unity.com/). This is the first synthetic person re-identification dataset with a set-up similar to real video surveillance systems, i.e. with a camera network and multiple people moving at the same time. The dataset contains 1,801,816 synthesized person images of 8,000 identities. Images in this dataset generally contain different viewpoints, poses, illuminations, backgrounds, occlusions, and resolutions, as shown in Fig. 1. 

### Download Links
Due to the large amount of data, currently only the image subset used in the experiments of our paper is provided in Google Drive, including 132,145 images. All data is provided in Baidu Yun Drive, including videos and images (The video is uploading). Images include images and key points position. They can be downloaded from the following links.

The filenames are encoded as follows. Take "000000_s00_c00_f000264.jpg" as an example,
*  000000 is the id of the person
*  s00   is the id of the scene
*  c00   is the id of the camera
*  f000264   is the number of frames

camera*_*_point.txt Data format: image name, the upper left corner of the video x, the upper left corner of the video y, the lower right corner of the video x, the lower right corner of the video y, the distance of head point in the image from the upper left corner x (The following distances are from the upper left corner), the distance y of head point in the image, left shoulder distance x, left shoulder distance y, right shoulder x, right shoulder y, left hand x, left hand y, right hand x, right hand y, left foot x, left foot y, right foot x, right foot y

## Characters and Scenes

We design a method to generate a large number of random UV texture maps and use them to create different 3D clothing models. The method is shown in Fig2, colors and texture patterns are combined to create random UV texture maps. Fig.3 shows the texture patterns we used is shown. Then, an automatic code is developed to randomly generate various different 3D characters with diverse clothes, races and attributes. Fig. 4 shows examples of our generated clothing and characters.

Next, we simulate a number of different virtual environments (including 11 scenes, eight outdoor and three indoor, as shown in Fig. 5) using Unity3D, with customized camera networks similar to real surveillance systems. Finally, we import multiple 3D characters at the same time, with various movements and interactions along different paths through the camera networks. The simulation is illustrated in Fig. 6.

## Experimental Results

By training person re-identification models on these synthesized person images, we demonstrate, for the first time, that models trained on virtual data can generalize
well to unseen target images, surpassing the models trained on various real-world datasets, including CUHK03, Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and almost MSMT17. The experimental results are shown in the following tables.
